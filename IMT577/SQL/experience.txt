I live with my wife and daughter in Jackson Heignts, NY. For the past five years I've been working for a small eComerce company where I've worn many hats, from Software Development Engineer to Analyst, to Technical Program Manager.

I'm excited to take this and other BI courses to learn about how organizations leverage data to solve business problems.

Something people might not know about me is that I transitioned to my current career after training and having a career as an opera singer.
